## Sudoku-with-Swing
This is a simple Java program implementing the classic 15 Puzzle game. The project was inspired by my experiences in class and during my previous project involving Sudoku. I remember playing the 15 Puzzle game as a child, so I decided to apply my Swing and Java skills to create this version.

### Features
Multiple Difficulty Levels: Enjoy Sudoku puzzles ranging from beginner to expert difficulty, ensuring a suitable challenge for players of all skill levels. Implemented using Java Swing for the graphical interface and linked lists for game functionality, this project is designed to be a fun and engaging endeavor. All the game logic is original, showcasing my coding prowess in implementing the intricate mechanics of Sudoku, even though I understood the game's principles beforehand.
### How to Play
Clone the repository and compile the Java source code.
Run the Java program to launch the Sudoku game.
Select your preferred difficulty level and start solving Sudoku puzzles with ease.
### Future Updates
I plan to continue working on this project, making incremental improvements and adding new features over time. This includes refining the user interface, optimizing the game logic, and incorporating user feedback. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
